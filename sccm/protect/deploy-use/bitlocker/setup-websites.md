# Set up BitLocker portals

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

<!--3601034-->

To use the following BitLocker management components in Configuration Manager, you first need to install them:

- User self-service portal
- Administration and monitoring website (helpdesk portal)

You can install the portals on an existing site server with IIS, or use a standalone web server to host them.

> [!NOTE]
> In version 1910, only install the self-service portal and the administration and monitoring website with a primary site database. In a hierarchy, install these websites for each primary site.

Before you start, confirm the [prerequisites](/configmgr/protect/plan-design/bitlocker-management#prerequisites) for these components.

## Script usage

This process uses a PowerShell script, MBAMWebSiteInstaller.ps1, to install these components on the web server. It accepts the following parameters:

- `-SqlServerName <ServerName>` (required): The fully qualified domain name of the primary site database server.

- `-SqlInstanceName <InstanceName>`: The SQL Server instance name for the primary site database. This parameter is optional if SQL uses the default instance.

- `-SqlDatabaseName <DatabaseName>` (required): The name of the primary site database, for example `CM_ABC`.

- `-ReportWebServiceUrl <ReportWebServiceUrl>`: The web service URL of the primary site's reporting service point. It's the **Web Service URL** value in **Reporting Services Configuration Manager**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This parameter is to install the **Recovery Audit Report** that's linked from the administration and monitoring website. By default Configuration Manager includes the other BitLocker management reports.

- `-HelpdeskUsersGroupName <DomainUserGroup>`: For example, `contoso\BitLocker help desk users`. A domain user group whose members have access to the **Manage TPM** and **Drive Recovery** areas of the administration and monitoring website. When using these options, this role needs to fill in all fields, including the user's domain and account name.

- `-HelpdeskAdminsGroupName <DomainUserGroup>`: For example, `contoso\BitLocker help desk admins`. A domain user group whose members have access to all recovery areas of the administration and monitoring website. When helping users recover their drives, this role only has to enter the recovery key.

- `-MbamReportUsersGroupName <DomainUserGroup>`: For example, `contoso\BitLocker report users`. A domain user group whose members have read-only access to the **Reports** area of the administration and monitoring website.

- `-SiteInstall Both`: Specify which of the components to install. Valid options include:
  - `Both`: Install both components
  - `HelpDesk`: Install only the administration and monitoring website
  - `SSP`: Install only the self-service portal

- `IISWebSite`: The website where the script installs the MBAM web applications. By default, it uses the IIS default website.

- `InstallDirectory`: The path where the script installs the web application files. By default, this path is `C:\inetpub`.

## Run the script

On the target web server, do the following actions:

> [!NOTE]
> Depending upon your site design, you may need to run the script multiple times. For example, run the script on the management point to install the administration and monitoring website. Then run it again on a standalone web server to install the self-service portal.

1. Copy the following files from `SMSSETUP\BIN\X64` in the Configuration Manager installation folder on the site server to a local folder on the target server:

    - `MBAMWebSite.cab`
    - `MBAMWebSiteInstaller.ps1`

1. Run PowerShell as an administrator, and then run the script similar to the following command line:

    ``` PowerShell
    .\MBAMWebSiteInstaller.ps1 -SqlServerName <ServerName> -SqlInstanceName <InstanceName> -SqlDatabaseName <DatabaseName> -ReportWebServiceUrl <ReportWebServiceUrl> -HelpdeskUsersGroupName <DomainUserGroup> -HelpdeskAdminsGroupName <DomainUserGroup> -MbamReportUsersGroupName <DomainUserGroup> -SiteInstall Both
    ```

    For example,

    ``` PowerShell
    .\MBAMWebSiteInstaller.ps1 -SqlServerName sql.contoso.com -SqlInstanceName instance1 -SqlDatabaseName CM_ABC -ReportWebServiceUrl https://rsp.contoso.com/ReportServer -HelpdeskUsersGroupName "contoso\BitLocker help desk users" -HelpdeskAdminsGroupName "contoso\BitLocker help desk admins" -MbamReportUsersGroupName "contoso\BitLocker report users" -SiteInstall Both
    ```

After installation, access the portals via the following URLs:

- Self-service portal: `https://webserver.contoso.com/SelfService`
- Administration and monitoring website: `https://webserver.contoso.com/HelpDesk/#`

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft recommends but doesn't require the use of HTTPS. For more information, see [How to set up SSL on IIS](https://docs.microsoft.com/iis/manage/configuring-security/how-to-set-up-ssl-on-iis).

## Verify

Monitor and troubleshoot using the following logs:

- Windows Event logs under **Microsoft-Windows-MBAM-Web**. For more information, see [About BitLocker event logs](/configmgr/protect/tech-ref/bitlocker/about-event-logs) and [Server event logs](/configmgr/protect/tech-ref/bitlocker/server-event-logs).

- Trace logs for each component are in the following default locations:

  - Self-service portal: `C:\inetpub\Microsoft BitLocker Management Solution\Logs\Self Service Website`

  - Administration and monitoring website: `C:\inetpub\Microsoft BitLocker Management Solution\Logs\Help Desk Website`

For more troubleshooting information, see [Troubleshoot BitLocker](/configmgr/protect/tech-ref/bitlocker/troubleshoot).
